			<h2 class="section-heading">Background</h2>
            <p>The income imbalance between genders has been a hot topic of societal issues recently. This issue is more commonly known as the ‘pay gap’, the theory that males earn more than females on average of <b>20%</b>. These issues have been looked at several times in the past and has created awareness in society. </p>
			
            <h2 class="section-heading">The dataset</h2>
			<p>The assigned dataset we are analysing is the 2011 and 2016 census data on <b>personal income per week</b>. This is sorted by gender as well as age, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of income distribution throughout Australia. Since the geographical regions of <b>SA1</b> has changed significantly over time, we will use the <b>Postal Areas</b> instead. The dataset is collected to allow the government to check the income distribution throughout aggregated levels. It is also a big factor on determining minimum wage and gender equality issues. <br>The WGEA uses this data to analyse existing issues based on age and gender, to further examine pay inequalities. Almost all government departments that deal with income will use this, from local councils to federal aggregates. At a national level income information assists in the planning of the provision of health care, education and employment. Locally it is used to plan services such as social housing and skill training. All marketing sectors in various industries can use this data in order to cater products or services to specific age ranges, and to set appropriate pricing in the area. The real estate agencies may even use this to determine pricing and lease within separate regions. The base distribution through Sydney is quite interesting, as high income areas are primarily in the north shore regions, this actually represents the latte line extremely well, as it is calculated using wealth and education.</p>
          
			<h2 class="section-heading">Analysis</h2>
			<p>Initially, our aim was to analyse each pay bracket and find trends and growth between the two years, however, the data was collected differently between the two years, and as such it is impossible to create an accurate representation between the two. Thankfully, the data in 2016 includes incomes of $2000-$2999, and by concatenating the range with the over $3000 set, we were able to have a matching range of incomes greater than $2000 on both datasets.</p>
			<p>Focusing on high incomes is still relevant to our study, according to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, <b>5 out of 6 CEOs are male and female KMP level managers are earning 28.9% less than males within the same role. On average, Males are reported to earn nearly $27,000 a year more than women and up to $93,884 on high income roles such as management. Source (WGEA).</b> This pay gap is more prevalent in non-labour activities, with up to a <b>29.6% pay gap</b> in Financial and Insurance services.</p>
			<p>To visualise and maintain an accurate display of results, we used the number of females and males in each area that are earning greater than $2000, divided by the amount of females and males in the area excluding non-stated results. This allowed us to distribute regions of high income based on a ratio of wealthier individuals.</p>
			
			<h2 class="section-heading">The Comparison</h2>
			<p>The latte line is usually determined with either education or income, and since we are analysing income, we should be able to directly compare it to education. The education dataset is ordered well and has not changed format over the 5 years, for that reason we should be able to find a correlation between education and income. The education dataset was edited similarly to income, which we used the total of year 12 graduates, divided by the population in the area to calculate a ratio within the area. Keeping in mind the non-stated fields were removed from the total population. What we found was the growth and income difference.</p>
